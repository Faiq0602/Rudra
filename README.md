Hello , this is the website which i ended up making for the recruitment test for rudra. Unfortunately i couldnt manage time to add javascript into it and make it working. And because of that it is just like a blueprint of how the website could look. I didnt started early enough and spent most of my time in looking at various sites for inspiration , now i feel like i could have done pretty much more if i started earlier.

Edit : I have added the feature for adding/removing toppings. It uses javascript to targets the desired id and changes the source of image on the action of the click of button. But im still stuck on the part for dividing the image into n parts when the key is pressed. I somewhat know that its related to deviding a circle into n equal parts but i am unable to do it in terms of equal parts. I am able to do it if instead of number of part we enter the value of angle.
